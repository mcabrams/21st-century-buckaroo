        <p>In 1984 "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension" was released. It's a fantastic film about one of the world's top neurosurgeons. I guess it's also about this guy who designs and drives supersonic jet-cars, super-dimensionaln jet-cars, heck, just really awesome jet-cars in general.

        It's also about a master of bujutsu who's an expert marksman with a sixgun. Then there's the guy that plays electric guitar, pocket trumpet and sings in his very own rock band - he speaks a ton of languages and his written songs in all of them. There's also a particle physicist, comic book hero, and a guy who has an entire organization of supporters and fans who aid him wherever he goes. I probably should have mentioned it earlier, but this is actually the same "guy": Buckaroo Banzai.</p>
        <h2><q>He thinks he's Einstein, James Bond and Batman all rolled into one!</q></h2>
        <p>Buckaroo is a true ace-of-all-trades, a renaissance man of the 1980s going on the 22nd century. The character immediately appealed to me and every other 10 year old kid who has seen the movie. He did everything, he did it well, and he was <strong>cool</strong>. All that said, he wasn't perfect (that was left to &quot;Perfect Tommy&quot;, Buckaroo's rhythm guitar playing, aforementioned jet-car suspension designer, and overall spectacle of a human being). <img src="http://www.worldwatchonline.com/card04.jpg" title="opt title" alt="Perfect Tommy being perfect" /></p>
        <p>In my life, I nor anybody else has come close to mirroring Buckaroo's breadth of knowledge and general &quot;coolness.&quot; However, perhaps subconsciously under his influence, I have ended up invested in a variety of fields and interests.</p>
        <p>I majored in biology with a specialization in neuroscience at the rigorous University of Chicago, I've produced and released original music and remixes, I've designed user interfaces, drawn digital artwork, I've started a non-profit, been part of two startups, and more recently I've developed web applications and websites. That may sound like an attempted boisterous list of past endeavors, but the truth is that most of it has been a path of serendipity and less of a deliberate calculation. I'm not yet close to being an expert in each of those fields by far, but there is a certain joy to being involved in so many different channels. I've also found there are many benefits.</p>
        <p>That said, there is a definitely a feeling of being drawn to thin. With so many competing interests it becomes difficult to do each one well, yet alone do one supremely well. I have no plans of pruning any of my hobbies, but I am trying to focus more on development, design and music - without the ability to create something, I find that things become stale.</p>

        <p>Anyways, what does that have to do with web development and this blog? Well, these days creating a website, and really doing it well, requires a similar amalgamation of talents to those of Buckaroo.</p>
        <p>The entire process of creating a website (not even talking about a web app, yet), requires a knowledge of design, development, content, and an ability to spread what you have created with others. Perhaps I should just jump into projects and learn as I go along, but I often feel a need to have all the pieces ready to go beforehand - which may be why that after a year and half of being involved in development and design, this is the first substantial creation of mine.</p>

        <p>So, I in many ways consider this to be the maiden voyage - I know 5% of what I need to, but it's enough to get started, and I'm tired of waiting. It's been a long time leading up to it, but life takes its twists and turns and &quot;no matter where you go, there you are.&quot;</p>
        <p>p.s. In case that last paragraph header wasn't clear, I still want to be an astronaut.</p>
