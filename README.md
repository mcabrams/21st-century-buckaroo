My first legit personal website and blog, built from the ground up.

Inspiration for workflow, design patterns, techniques, and overall approach owes much to the following sources:

- [Responsive Design Workflow](http://www.responsivedesignworkflow.com)
- [CSS Wizardry](http://www.CSSWizardry.com)
- [CSS-Tricks](http://www.css-tricks.com)
