<p><strong>Buckaroo Banzai</strong>. He's one of the world's top neurosurgeons. He designs and drives supersonic jet-cars, heck, spoiler alert, but they're actually <em>super-dimensional</em> jet-cars. He's a master of bujutsu and an expert marksman with a sixgun. He plays electric guitar, pocket trumpet and sings in his very own rock band - while we're on the topic, he speaks a ton of languages and his written songs in all of them. He's also a particle physicist, comic book hero, and has an entire organization of supporters and fans who aid him wherever he goes.</p>
<p>Buckaroo Banzai is a character from the 1984 film &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot;; he is a true ace-of-all-trades, a renaissance man of the 1980s going on the 22nd century. The character immediately appealed to me and every other 10 year old kid who has seen the movie. He did everything, he did it well, and he was <strong>cool</strong>. All that said, he wasn't perfect (that was left to &quot;Perfect Tommy&quot;, Buckaroo's rhythm guitar playing, aforementioned jet-car suspension designer, and overall spectacle of a human being). <img src="http://www.worldwatchonline.com/card04.jpg" title="opt title" alt="Perfect Tommy being perfect" /></p>
<p>In my life, I nor anybody else has come close to mirroring Buckaroo's breadth of knowledge and general &quot;coolness.&quot; However, perhaps subconsciously under his influence, I have ended up invested in a variety of fields and interests.</p>
<p>I majored in biology with a specialization in neuroscience at the rigorous University of Chicago, I've produced and released original music and remixes, I've designed user interfaces, drawn digital artwork, I've started a non-profit, been part of two startups, and more recently I've developed web applications and websites. That may sound like an attempted boisterous list of past endeavors, but the truth is that most of it has been a path of serendipity and less of a deliberate calculation. I'm not yet close to being an expert in each of those fields by far, but there is a certain joy to being involved in so many different channels. I've also found there are many benefits.</p>
<p>That said, there is a definitely a feeling of being drawn to thin. With so many competing interests it becomes difficult to do each one well, yet alone do one supremely well. I have no plans of pruning any of my hobbies, but I am trying to focus more on development, design and music - without the ability to create something, I find that things become stale.</p>

<p>Anyways, what does that have to do with web development and this blog? Well, these days creating a website, and really doing it well, requires a similar amalgamation of talents to those of Buckaroo.</p>
<p>The entire process of creating a website (not even talking about a web app, yet), requires a knowledge of design, development, content, and an ability to spread what you have created with others. Perhaps I should just jump into projects and learn as I go along, but I often feel a need to have all the pieces ready to go beforehand - which may be why that after a year and half of being involved in development and design, this is the first substantial creation of mine.</p>

<p>So, I in many ways consider this to be the maiden voyage - I know 5% of what I need to, but it's enough to get started, and I'm tired of waiting. It's been a long time leading up to it, but life takes its twists and turns and &quot;no matter where you go, there you are.&quot;</p>
<p>p.s. In case that last paragraph header wasn't clear, I still want to be an astronaut.</p>
<!-- Ace of all trades - buckaroo banzai - do one thing well -->

<!-- Life takes you where it may - you make decisions that seem best at the time -->

<!-- I was just speaking to a friend the other day about regret. "Regret nothing," is a cliché, and hyperbolic, but there's some truth to it. Every decision a person has made in their life was at some point the "best" possible choice out of all their options. When I say "best," I don't necessarily mean "most noble," "most thought out," "most forward thinking," instead I mean that it was the best thing to do (in that person's mind) at that the single moment in time, in that context, all things considered - and in life there are many things to consider. I wish I remembered more from the single economics course I took in college, but it boils down to every decision weighing cost and benefit - the mechanics in place for making that judgment call aren't always up to snuff, but we all have to operate with what we're given. We are who we are, and like it or not, we're essentially beautiful, mysteriously complex walking chemical reactions with impossibly complex formulas and equations. -->
